/**
 * An IContainer implementation which can be used for cursors and select ranges
 * where browser scaling is relevant.
 *
 * The problem is that with having 1x1 pixel elements which are sized then to the actual size with a
 * scale transform this cannot be combined properly with a browser zoom.
 *
 * The browser will apply first the browser zoom to the 1x1px element and then apply the scale leaving it always
 * at full scale instead of a 50% browser zoom.
 *
 * This is solved in this container by scaling the element first up to a higher degree (as specified)
 * so that the browser can do a scaling according to typical zoom levels and then the scaling will work.
